    <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This refund and cancellation policy outlines how you can cancel or seek a refund for a product/service purchased through our Platform.</p>

    <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>Cancellations will only be considered if requested within 7 days of placing the order. However, if the order has already been communicated to sellers/merchants listed on the Platform and they have initiated shipping, or if the product is out for delivery, cancellation requests may not be entertained. In such a case, you may choose to reject the product upon delivery.</p>

    <p>If you have complaints regarding products with a manufacturerâ€™s warranty, please refer the issue to them directly.</p>

    <p>In the case of any refunds approved by ARTHSUTRAM SOLUTION PRIVATE LIMITED, it will take 7 days for the refund to be processed.</p>

    <h2>Return Policy</h2>
    <p>We offer refunds/exchanges within the first 30 days from the date of purchase. If 30 days have passed, we will not offer a return, exchange, or refund of any kind.</p>

    <p>To be eligible for a return or exchange, the purchased item must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>* Be unused and in the same condition as received</li>
        <li>* Have its original packaging</li>
        <li>* Items purchased on sale may not be eligible for a return/exchange</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Only items found defective or damaged are eligible for replacement based on an exchange request.</p>
